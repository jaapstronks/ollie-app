### 1.2 Landing Page & Email List

**URL:** ollie-app.com (or similar)

**Page content:**
- Hero: "The free puppy logbook" + app screenshots
- Feature highlights (timeline, predictions, training library)
- "Coming soon to iOS & Apple Watch"
- Email signup: "Get notified at launch + 7-day free Ollie+ trial"
- Language selector (show commitment to localization)

**Email sequence (post-signup):**
1. Welcome + what to expect
2. Week 2: Feature preview (screenshots)
3. Week 4: "We're almost ready" + beta invite (if still open)
4. Launch day: Download link + trial code

**Tools:** Carrd/Framer for landing page, Mailchimp/ConvertKit for emails

### 1.3 Localization (LLM-Powered — 20+ Languages at Launch)

**New reality:** With GPT-4/Claude, translation is nearly free. Launch in 20+ languages from day one.

#### Launch Languages (All at Once)

| Region | Languages | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Western Europe** | English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese | Core markets |
| **Nordic** | Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish | High purchasing power |
| **Eastern Europe** | Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian | Growing markets |
| **Asia** | Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified), Thai | High engagement |
| **Other** | Turkish, Arabic, Russian, Indonesian | Scale markets |

**Total: 20+ languages at ~€0 marginal cost**

#### LLM Translation Workflow

```
1. Export strings from Xcode String Catalog (JSON)
2. Feed to Claude/GPT-4 with context:
   "Translate this puppy tracking app UI to [language].
    Keep it friendly, casual, use local pet terminology.
    Preserve placeholders like {name} and {count}."
3. Generate all 20 languages in one session (~1 hour work)
4. Self-review: Ask LLM to check for consistency issues
5. Optional: Pay native speaker €20-30 for spot-check (not full review)
```

**App Store metadata (critical for ASO):**
- Title + subtitle: LLM translate, then verify keywords rank in that market
- Description: LLM translate with instruction to localize culturally
- Keywords: Research per market (LLM can suggest, but verify with ASO tool)

#### Quality Assurance

| Check | How |
|-------|-----|
| Placeholder handling | Automated script to verify {name} etc. preserved |
| Length issues | Run in simulator, check for truncation |
| Cultural fit | Ask LLM: "Does this sound natural in [language]?" |
| Spot check | Reddit/Discord: "Native [language] speaker? Can you check 10 strings?" |

**Cost: ~€0-100 total** (vs. €2,000+ for agency translation of 20 languages)

### 1.4 LLM-Powered Organic Outreach

**Philosophy:** Use AI to scale personalized outreach, not to spam. Every message should be genuinely helpful and relevant.

#### Automated Community Discovery

Use Claude/GPT-4 to find and categorize communities:

```
Prompt: "Find online communities (Reddit, Facebook, Discord, forums) where
new puppy owners gather. For each, note:
- Platform and name
- Size (members)
- Rules about self-promotion
- Best approach for genuine engagement
- Language/region"
```

**Target list to build:**

| Platform | Community Type | Target Count |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Reddit | Breed subreddits (r/labrador, r/goldenretrievers, etc.) | 50+ |
| Reddit | Training/advice (r/puppy101, r/dogtraining) | 10+ |
| Facebook | "New Puppy Owners" groups | 30+ |
| Facebook | Breed-specific groups | 50+ |
| Discord | Pet/dog servers | 20+ |
| Forums | Breed forums, dog training forums | 20+ |
| Local | Dutch/German/French dog communities | 30+ |

**Estimated reach: 500,000+ potential users across all communities**

#### Automated Personalized Outreach

**1. Breeder/Shelter Outreach (Email)**

```
Script:
1. LLM generates list of breeders/shelters from Google (by country)
2. Find contact emails (manual or with tool)
3. LLM writes personalized email per breeder:

"Hi [Breeder Name],

I came across [Kennel Name] while researching [Breed] breeders in [Country].
Your puppies look wonderful!

I'm building a free app called Ollie that helps new puppy owners track potty
training, meals, and sleep. Many first-time owners struggle with "when did
he last pee?" — Ollie solves that.

Would you be open to recommending it to your puppy buyers? I'd be happy to
send you some cards with a QR code, or just a link you can share.

No cost, no catch — just trying to help new puppy parents succeed.

[Your name]"

4. Send 10-20 personalized emails per day (not spam, genuine outreach)
```

**Target: 200+ breeders/shelters contacted → 20+ partnerships**

**2. Influencer Outreach (Instagram/TikTok)**

```
Script:
1. Search hashtags: #puppylife #newpuppy #puppytraining #[breed]puppy
2. Find accounts with 5K-100K followers, recent puppy content
3. LLM writes personalized DM:

"Hey [Name]!

I've been following [Puppy Name]'s journey — that video of the zoomies
was hilarious 😄

I built a free puppy tracking app (Ollie) and would love to give you
premium access. No obligation to post — just hoping it helps with
[Puppy Name]'s training!

Want me to send a TestFlight link?"

4. Send 20-30 DMs per day across platforms
```

**Target: 300+ influencers contacted → 50+ beta testers → 10+ organic posts**

**3. Reddit Engagement (Helpful, Not Promotional)**

```
Strategy: Be genuinely helpful first, mention app naturally when relevant.

LLM assists with:
- Finding relevant threads (potty training questions, schedule questions)
- Drafting helpful responses with real advice
- Naturally mentioning "I built a free app that helped me track this"

Example response:
"The key with potty training is consistency and tracking. Most puppies
need to go:
- After waking up
- After eating/drinking
- After play
- Every 2-3 hours otherwise

I was terrible at remembering, so I built a simple app to track it.
After a week of data, I could predict when my pup needed to go. Happy
to share if you're interested (it's free)."

Rules:
- Never post the same message twice
- Always provide genuine value first
- Only mention app when truly relevant
- Follow subreddit rules strictly
- Max 3-5 posts/comments per day (quality over quantity)
```

**Target: 100+ helpful posts/comments → 500+ organic installs**

**4. Blog Content Generation**

```
LLM generates SEO-optimized blog posts:

Topics:
- "Puppy Potty Training Schedule by Age (Week by Week Guide)"
- "How Long Can a Puppy Hold Their Bladder? Complete Chart"
- "First Week with a New Puppy: Hour-by-Hour Survival Guide"
- "Puppy Sleep Schedule: How Much Sleep Does Your Puppy Need?"
- "[Breed] Puppy Training Tips: What I Wish I Knew"

Each post:
- 1,500-2,500 words
- Genuinely helpful content
- Natural mention of Ollie app where relevant
- Translated to 5-10 languages for local SEO

Hosting: Simple blog on ollie-app.com or Medium
```

**Target: 20+ blog posts → Long-term organic search traffic**

## Phase 2: Launch Week

### 2.1 App Store Optimization (ASO)

#### App Name & Subtitle
```
Name: Ollie - Puppy Logbook
Subtitle: Track potty, sleep & training
```

**Localized examples:**
- 🇩🇪 "Ollie - Welpen Tagebuch" / "Protokolliere Pipi, Schlaf & Training"
- 🇫🇷 "Ollie - Carnet Chiot" / "Suivez pipi, sommeil & dressage"

#### Keywords (100 characters max)
**English:**
```
puppy,tracker,potty,training,dog,logbook,sleep,journal,pet,housebreaking,crate,schedule,newborn
```

**Strategy:**
- Include high-volume terms: "puppy", "dog", "training", "potty"
- Include problem terms: "housebreaking", "crate training"
- Avoid brand names (against guidelines)
- Localize keywords per market (German: "Welpe", "Stubenreinheit")

#### App Store Description

```

**Tactics:**
- Ask beta testers to review on day 1
- In-app review prompt (SKStoreReviewController) after:
  - 7 days of use AND
  - 20+ events logged AND
  - User has not been asked in last 30 days
- Never ask immediately after a negative experience

**Review response:**

**Tagline options:**
- "The free puppy logbook for new dog parents"

**First comment (as maker):**
```
Hey PH! 👋

I built Ollie because when I got my puppy, I was drowning in "was that pee or
poop?", "when did he last eat?", and "is 4 hours of sleep normal?"

Ollie is 100% free for the core features — log everything, see your timeline,
get basic stats. No trial, no limits.

If you want smart predictions ("your puppy will need to pee in ~20 min") and
advanced analytics, that's Ollie+ for €2.99/mo.

Would love your feedback! What features would help you with your puppy?
```

---

## Phase 3: Community Seeding

### 3.1 Reddit Strategy

**Target subreddits:**

| Subreddit | Subscribers | Approach |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| r/puppy101 | 500K+ | Helpful comments → soft promo |
| r/dogs | 3M+ | Same as above |
| r/DogTraining | 700K+ | Training-focused posts |
| r/Dogtraining | 200K+ | (different sub, same approach) |
| r/BostonTerrier, r/goldenretrievers, etc. | Varies | Breed-specific value posts |

**Rules:**
- Read subreddit rules first (many ban self-promo)
- Build karma before posting about your app
- Lead with value: "Here's what I learned about potty training" → mention app organically
- Never spam multiple subs with same post

**Post templates:**

**Value-first post:**
```
Title: I tracked 847 potty breaks over 3 months — here's what I learned

[Actual insights from your data]

I built a small app to track all this if anyone's interested (free, no ads).
```

**Help request (builds goodwill):**
```
Title: Building a puppy tracking app — what features would you actually use?

I'm building a free app to help new puppy owners track potty, meals, sleep, etc.
What would make this useful for you? What do existing apps get wrong?
```

### 3.2 Facebook Groups

**Target groups:**
- "Puppy Training Tips & Tricks" (100K+ members)
- "New Puppy Owners Support Group"
- Breed-specific groups (Golden Retriever, Labrador, etc.)
- Local groups ("Dog Owners [City]")

**Approach:**
- Join groups 4+ weeks before launch
- Be helpful (answer questions about puppies)
- Ask admin permission before any promo
- Post: "Free app I found helpful" (if allowed) or organic mentions

### 3.3 Dog Influencer Partnerships

**Criteria:**
- 10K-100K followers (micro-influencers, higher engagement)
- Puppy content (not just adult dogs)
- Authentic, not overly promotional
- Active engagement in comments

**Outreach template:**
```
Subject: Free puppy app for [Puppy's name]?

Hey [Name]!

I've been following [Puppy's name]'s journey and love the content.

I built a free puppy tracking app (Ollie) that helps log potty breaks, sleep,
training, etc. No ads, no required subscription.

Would you be open to trying it? I'd love to give you free Ollie+ (the premium
version) and hear your honest feedback.

No obligation to post — just hoping it helps!

[Your name]
```

**Compensation tiers:**
- Micro (10-50K): Free Ollie+ lifetime
- Mid (50-100K): Free Ollie+ + small fee ($100-200)
- Large (100K+): Negotiate based on rates

### 3.4 Breeder & Shelter Partnerships

**Value proposition:**
- Recommend Ollie to new puppy owners
- Provide "New Puppy Kit" with app QR code
- Track early data (meals, potty) before handoff

**Outreach:**
- Contact local breeders
- Partner with shelters for adoption kits
- Offer co-branded materials (printed cards)

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Meta Ads (Instagram & Facebook)

#### Account Setup

1. **Business Manager:** Create Meta Business Suite account
2. **Pixel:** Install Meta Pixel on landing page (for web conversions)
3. **App Events:** Integrate Meta SDK in iOS app for in-app events
4. **Product Catalog:** Not needed (not e-commerce)

#### Tracking Setup (Critical for Automation)

**Install Meta SDK:**
```swift
// In AppDelegate or App init
import FBSDKCoreKit

// Standard events to track:
AppEvents.shared.logEvent(.completedRegistration)  // Profile created
AppEvents.shared.logEvent(.subscribe)              // Ollie+ purchased
AppEvents.shared.logEvent(.startTrial)            // Trial started

// Custom events:
AppEvents.shared.logEvent("event_logged", parameters: ["type": "plassen"])
AppEvents.shared.logEvent("day_7_active")         // Retained 7 days
```

**Conversion API (server-side):**
- More reliable than pixel alone
- Required for iOS 14.5+ (ATT prompt)
- Send events from your backend if you have one

#### Campaign Structure

```
Campaign: Ollie User Acquisition
├── Ad Set: Interest - New Puppy Owners
│   ├── Ad: Video - "Track everything free"
│   ├── Ad: Carousel - Feature showcase
│   └── Ad: Static - Cute puppy + app screenshot
├── Ad Set: Interest - Dog Training

├── Ad Set: Lookalike - Ollie+ Subscribers
│   └── [Same ad variations]
└── Ad Set: Retargeting - App Installers No Trial
    └── Ad: "Unlock predictions with Ollie+"
```

#### Audience Targeting

**Interest-based (cold):**
- New puppy owner
- Puppy training
- Dog adoption
- Pet supplies (recent purchasers)
- Specific breeds (Labrador, Golden Retriever, French Bulldog)
- Parenting (correlates with pet ownership)

**Behavior-based:**
- Engaged shoppers

- Newlyweds (life event → pet)

**Lookalike audiences (best performers):**
- 1% lookalike of Ollie+ subscribers (once you have 100+)
- 1% lookalike of 7-day retained users
- 1% lookalike of high-engagement users (50+ events)

**Retargeting:**
- App installed, no trial started
- Trial started, no conversion
- Churned subscribers (win-back)

#### Ad Creative

**Video ads (best performers on Instagram):**

| Format | Length | Hook | Content |
|--------|--------|------|---------|
| Reels | 15-30s | Cute puppy struggling | "Track accidents → celebrate wins" |
| Stories | 15s | "POV: You just got a puppy" | App solves the chaos |
| Feed | 30-60s | Problem statement | Feature walkthrough |

**Static ads:**
- Puppy photo + phone with app
- Before/after (chaotic notes → clean app)
- Testimonial overlay on app screenshot

**Carousel ads:**
- Slide 1: Hook (puppy photo)
- Slide 2-4: Features (timeline, predictions, training)
- Slide 5: CTA ("Download free")

**Copy formulas:**

```
Hook: New puppy? You need this (free) app.

Body: Track every potty break, meal, and nap in seconds.
No more guessing when they last went out.

CTA: Download Ollie — it's free.
```

```
Hook: I wish I had this when I got my puppy.

Body: Ollie tracks everything so you don't have to remember.
- Potty predictions
- Sleep patterns

Free to use. Premium insights if you want them.

CTA: Get Ollie free →
```

#### Budget & Bidding

**Test phase (Month 1):**
- Daily budget: €20-50/day
- Split across 3-4 ad sets
- Optimize for: App Installs
- Bid strategy: Lowest cost

**Scale phase (Month 2+):**
- Daily budget: €100-500/day (based on CAC targets)
- Optimize for: Trial starts or Ollie+ purchases
- Bid strategy: Cost cap (set max CAC)

**Target metrics:**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CPM (cost per 1K impressions) | €3-8 |
| CTR (click-through rate) | 1-3% |
| CPI (cost per install) | €1-3 |
| Cost per trial start | €3-8 |
| Cost per Ollie+ subscription | €15-40 |
| LTV:CAC ratio | > 3:1 |

#### A/B Testing Roadmap

**Week 1-2:** Test audiences (interest vs. lookalike)
**Week 3-4:** Test creative formats (video vs. static)
**Week 5-6:** Test hooks/copy variations
**Week 7-8:** Test landing page vs. direct App Store link
**Ongoing:** Test new creatives every 2 weeks (ad fatigue)

### 4.3 Apple Search Ads

**Why:**
- High intent (searching for puppy apps)
- Lower competition than Meta
- Often better CAC for app installs

**Campaign setup:**

```
Campaign: Ollie - Search Ads
├── Ad Group: Brand Terms
│   └── Keywords: "ollie", "ollie app", "ollie puppy"
├── Ad Group: Category Terms
│   └── Keywords: "puppy tracker", "puppy log", "dog diary"
├── Ad Group: Problem Terms
│   └── Keywords: "potty training app", "puppy schedule"
└── Ad Group: Competitor Terms
    └── Keywords: [competitor app names]
```

**Keyword strategy:**
- Exact match for high-intent terms
- Broad match for discovery (monitor and add negatives)
- Negative keywords: "adult dog", "cat", "free games"

**Budget:** Start €10-20/day, scale based on CAC

### 4.4 Automated Conversion Pipeline

**Goal:** Ads → Install → Onboarding → Engagement → Trial → Subscription (minimal manual work)

#### In-App Conversion Touchpoints

**Touchpoint 1: Onboarding completion**
```
After creating puppy profile:
"Start your 7-day free Ollie+ trial?"
[Start trial] [Maybe later]
```

**Touchpoint 2: First premium feature hit**
```
When user taps locked feature (predictions, training):
Show OlliePlusSheet with context:
"Unlock smart predictions with Ollie+"
```

**Touchpoint 3: Day 3 engagement**
```
In-app card after 20+ events logged:
"You're tracking like a pro! 🎉
See patterns with Ollie+ analytics."
```

**Touchpoint 4: Day 6 trial reminder (push notification)**
```
"Your Ollie+ trial ends tomorrow.
Keep your smart predictions?"
→ Opens app to subscription screen
```

**Touchpoint 5: Post-trial nudge (day 8)**
```
"Miss your potty predictions?
Resume Ollie+ anytime."
```

#### Attribution & Analytics

**Track the full funnel:**

| Event | Source | Tool |
|-------|--------|------|
| Ad impression | Meta | Meta Ads Manager |
| Ad click | Meta | Meta Ads Manager |
| App install | Meta + ASA | Meta SDK + ASA API |
| Profile created | App | Meta SDK + internal analytics |
| Trial started | App | Meta SDK + RevenueCat |
| Events logged | App | Internal analytics |
| 7-day retention | App | Internal analytics |
| Subscription purchased | App | RevenueCat + Meta SDK |
| Subscription renewed | App | RevenueCat |
| Churn | App | RevenueCat |

**Tools:**
- **RevenueCat:** Subscription management + analytics (free tier available)
- **Mixpanel/Amplitude:** Product analytics (funnel, retention)
- **Meta SDK:** Ad attribution
- **Adjust/AppsFlyer:** Multi-channel attribution (optional, paid)

#### Automation Rules

**Meta Ads automated rules:**
```
Rule 1: Pause underperformers
IF cost per trial start > €10 for 3 days
THEN pause ad set

Rule 2: Scale winners
IF cost per trial start < €5 AND spend > €50
THEN increase budget 20%

Rule 3: Creative fatigue
IF CTR drops 30% week-over-week
THEN notify to refresh creative
```

**RevenueCat webhooks:**
- On trial start → Send welcome email
- On trial cancel → Send win-back email
- On subscription → Update Meta conversion event
- On churn → Trigger win-back campaign

### 4.5 Bootstrap Budget Strategy

**Philosophy:** Organic-first, prove before you spend, never go cash-flow negative.

#### Initial Investment Cap
- **Maximum upfront:** €1,000
- **Extended budget (if proven):** €2,500
- **Reinvestment rate:** 100% of subscription revenue

#### Spending Gates (Only Unlock When Proven)

```
GATE 0: Pre-Launch (€0 ads)
├── Focus: 100% organic (Reddit, communities, beta testers)
├── Goal: 500+ installs, 20+ reviews, validate product-market fit
├── Unlock Gate 1 when: 5+ organic Ollie+ conversions
│
GATE 1: Small Test (€200 total)
├── Focus: Test 2-3 ad creatives, measure CAC
├── Budget: €5-10/day for 2-3 weeks
├── Goal: Find CAC < €30 per subscriber
├── Unlock Gate 2 when: CAC proven profitable (LTV:CAC > 2:1)
│
GATE 2: Validated Spend (€500 total from initial €1,000)
├── Focus: Scale winning creative, add Apple Search Ads
├── Budget: €15-25/day
├── Goal: 50+ paid subscribers
├── Unlock Gate 3 when: MRR covers ad spend (break-even)
│
GATE 3: Revenue-Funded Growth (reinvest 100% of MRR)
├── Focus: Scale what works, test new audiences
├── Budget: Whatever MRR allows (self-funding)
├── Goal: Grow MRR month-over-month
├── Extended budget: Unlock €2,500 if growth is consistent
│
GATE 4: Profit-Taking (future)
├── Focus: Maintain growth while taking profit
├── Budget: Reinvest 70%, keep 30% as income
└── Goal: Sustainable side income
```

#### Monthly Cash Flow Model (Conservative)

| Month | Ad Spend | New Subs | MRR | Cumulative Spend | Cumulative Revenue | Net Position |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 0 (launch) | €0 | 10 (organic) | €30 | €0 | €30 | +€30 |
| 1 | €100 | 15 | €75 | €100 | €105 | +€5 |
| 2 | €150 | 25 | €150 | €250 | €255 | +€5 |
| 3 | €200 | 40 | €270 | €450 | €525 | +€75 |
| 4 | €300 | 60 | €450 | €750 | €975 | +€225 |
| 5 | €450 | 90 | €720 | €1,200 | €1,695 | +€495 |
| 6 | €600 | 130 | €1,110 | €1,800 | €2,805 | +€1,005 |

**Assumptions:**
- Average subscription: €3/month (mix of monthly + annual)
- 15% monthly churn
- Trial-to-paid: 5%
- Paid CAC: €25 per subscriber (conservative)
- Organic continues alongside paid

**Key insight:** By Month 6, MRR (€1,110) exceeds ad spend (€600) — self-sustaining growth.

#### Kill Criteria (When to Stop/Pause)

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| CAC > €50 after €200 spent | Pause ads, focus on organic |
| Trial-to-paid < 2% | Fix conversion flow, don't scale |
| 30-day retention < 20% | Fix product, not marketing |
| MRR declining 2 months | Pause paid, investigate churn |

#### Channel Allocation (When Spending)

| Channel | % of Budget | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Apple Search Ads | 50% | Highest intent, often best CAC |
| Meta (Instagram) | 40% | Scale potential, good targeting |
| Influencer/other | 10% | Test only, high variance |

---

## Phase 5: Retention & Engagement

### 5.1 Push Notification Strategy

**Permission prompt timing:**
- After 3 successful event logs (not on first launch)
- Context: "Get reminders when it's time for a potty break?"

**Notification types:**

| Type | Trigger | Message |
|------|---------|---------|
| Potty reminder | 3h since last plas | "Time for a potty break? 🐕" |
| Meal reminder | Scheduled meal time | "Meal time for [Puppy]!" |
| Streak celebration | 7-day outdoor streak | "7 days no accidents! 🎉" |
| Trial ending | Day 6 of trial | "Your trial ends tomorrow" |
| Re-engagement | 3 days inactive | "How's [Puppy] doing?" |

**Frequency cap:** Max 3 notifications per day

### 5.2 Email Marketing

**Lifecycle emails:**

| Day | Email | Content |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 0 | Welcome | Tips for first week with puppy |
| 3 | Getting started | "Have you tried quick-log?" |
| 7 | Trial ending | "Keep your predictions?" |
| 14 | Value showcase | "You've logged X events! Here's what we learned" |
| 30 | Check-in | "How's potty training going?" |
| 60 | Feature highlight | "Did you know about training library?" |

**Segmentation:**
- Free users (nudge to trial)
- Trial users (nudge to convert)
- Subscribers (reduce churn, upsell annual)
- Churned (win-back offers)

### 5.3 Community Building

**Discord/Slack community:**
- Channel for puppy advice
- Feature request voting
- Beta testing announcements
- Direct line to developer

**Why it matters:**
- Reduces churn (community = stickiness)
- Free product feedback
- Word-of-mouth growth
- Content ideas from real users

| App Store rating | 4.5+ | Strong review push |
| Trial-to-paid | 4%+ | Conversion works |

| Net cash position | ≥ €0 | Not losing money |

### Month 6 (Sustainable Growth)

| Metric | Target | Why it matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Total installs | 10,000+ | Organic + small paid |
| Active subscribers | 300+ | Solid revenue base |

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Losing money overall** | Gate system prevents spending before validation; kill criteria stop bad bets early |
| Low trial conversion | Test pricing, improve value demo during trial; don't scale until 4%+ |
| High CAC | Focus on organic channels first; only scale paid when CAC < €30 proven |
| No organic traction | Indicates product/market fit issue — fix product, not marketing |
| Negative reviews | Rapid response, fix bugs fast; don't scale with < 4.0 rating |
| Competitor launch | Differentiate on "free forever" + design quality |
| iOS policy changes | Don't over-rely on Meta; Apple Search Ads less affected |
| Localization issues | Start with fewer languages, quality over quantity |

## Worst/Best/Likely Scenarios

**Worst case:**
- Organic doesn't work, ads don't work
- You've spent €500-750, learned what doesn't work
- Total loss: < €1,000 and some time

**Best case:**
- Organic explodes, you barely need ads
- 1,000 subscribers by Month 6, €3,000 MRR
- Profitable from Month 1
- **Side income becomes real income**

**Most likely case:**
- Organic gives you 50% of growth
- Small paid spend (€200-400/month) gives you 50%
- 300 subscribers by Month 6, €1,000 MRR
- Self-sustaining growth, slowly scaling profit
- **Exactly what you wanted: slow burn to profitability**
