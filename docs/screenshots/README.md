# App Store Screenshots Brief

6 screenshots, each with headline overlay + app UI.

## Design Guidelines
- **Background:** Warm, soft tones (cream/beige or soft gradient — not clinical white)
- **Typography:** Bold, friendly sans-serif (SF Pro Rounded or similar)
- **Phone frame:** iPhone 15 Pro style
- **Consistency:** Same background across all 6
- **No stock dog photos** — let the UI speak. Subtle paw/bone illustrations as accents are fine.
