## Part 1: Landing Page

### Hero Section
**Headline:**
> Puppyhood is chaos. Ollie brings the calm.

**Subheadline:**
> Track meals, potty, sleep & walks — and actually understand what your puppy needs.

**CTA:** Download on the App Store
**Secondary CTA:** See a day with Ollie →

### Value Proposition Section
**Section headline:**
> Your puppy lives in the now. Ollie helps you think ahead.

**Body:**
> Log your puppy's day in seconds. Ollie spots the patterns you can't see yet — so you know when the next potty break is coming, whether they slept enough, and if that second walk actually helped.

### Feature Blocks (3 cards)

**1. Daily Journal**
- Headline: "What happened today?"
- Copy: A beautiful timeline of your puppy's day. Log meals, potty, sleep, walks and milestones with one tap. Faster than opening Notes — because at 6am with a whining puppy, every second counts.
- Visual: screenshot of timeline view with a few logged events

**2. Smart Predictions**
- Headline: "Oh, that's why she's cranky"
- Copy: Potty gap predictions, sleep totals, outdoor streaks. The answers you're Googling at 2am — but based on your own puppy's actual data. Not generic breed advice. Your puppy.
- Visual: screenshot of stats/predictions view

**3. Weekly Overview**
- Headline: "Look how far you've come"
- Copy: See patterns emerge over days and weeks. Spot what's working, what's changing, and celebrate the wins — like that first full week without indoor accidents.
- Visual: screenshot of weekly summary or streak view

### Two Personas Section
> 📖 **Preparing for your puppy?**
> Start logging from day one. You'll thank yourself in week two.
>
> 🆘 **Already in the deep end?**
> Just start tracking. No setup, no imports. Patterns emerge fast.

### Social Proof
- If pre-launch: "Built by a puppy parent, in the trenches, for the trenches."
- Post-launch: real quotes from TestFlight users / early adopters
- Later: "Loved by X puppy parents" with rating stars

### Footer CTA
> Your puppy's first year goes fast. Don't try to remember it all — log it.
> [Download on the App Store]

## Part 3: App Store Screenshots (6 screens)

App Store allows up to 10 screenshots. Aim for 6 strong ones. Each screenshot should have a headline overlay + the app UI underneath.

### Screenshot 1 — Hero / First Impression
- **Headline overlay:** "Puppyhood is chaos. Ollie brings the calm."
- **Screen:** Timeline view with a few events logged (morning routine: wake up, potty, breakfast, walk)
- **Vibe:** Clean, warm, inviting. This sells the app.

### Screenshot 2 — One-Tap Logging
- **Headline overlay:** "Log anything in seconds"
- **Screen:** The event picker / quick-log UI showing the different event types (meal, potty, sleep, walk, etc.)
- **Vibe:** Fast, simple. Show that it's not a complicated form.

### Screenshot 3 — Smart Predictions
- **Headline overlay:** "Know what's coming next"
- **Screen:** Stats view showing potty gap prediction, sleep total, outdoor streak
- **Vibe:** Data that actually helps. Not overwhelming charts.

### Screenshot 4 — Daily Timeline
- **Headline overlay:** "Your puppy's day, at a glance"
- **Screen:** Full day timeline, nicely filled with various events, showing the visual flow of a day
- **Vibe:** Beautiful, satisfying, "I want to fill this in"

### Screenshot 5 — Patterns & Streaks
- **Headline overlay:** "Look how far you've come"
- **Screen:** Weekly overview or streak achievement (e.g. "7 days — all potty outside!")
- **Vibe:** Progress, pride. The emotional payoff.

### Screenshot 6 — Share with Partner
- **Headline overlay:** "Everyone on the same page"
- **Screen:** Could show sharing/export, or a "today so far" summary that could be shared
- **Vibe:** Teamwork. Practical.

### Design Guidelines for Screenshots
- **Background:** Warm, soft tones (cream/beige or soft gradient — not clinical white)
- **Typography:** Bold, friendly sans-serif for headlines (SF Pro Rounded or similar)
- **Phone frame:** Show device frame (iPhone 15 Pro style)
- **Consistency:** Same background treatment across all 6, only headline + screen content changes
- **No stock photos of dogs** — let the app UI do the talking. Maybe subtle paw print or bone illustrations as accents.

## Part 4: App Store Optimization Notes

### Search Strategy
**Primary terms to rank for:**
- puppy tracker
- puppy log
- puppy journal
- puppy potty tracker
- puppy schedule
- dog tracker (broader, harder)

**Secondary/long-tail:**
- puppy housebreaking
- puppy training log
- new puppy app
- puppy milestone tracker
- puppy potty training

### Competitor Landscape
Main competitors in "puppy tracker" space:
- **Puppy Coach** — more training-focused
- **Dog Health** — vet/medical focused
- **11pets** — broad pet management (not puppy-specific)
- **Zigzag** — puppy training program (subscription)

**Ollie's differentiator:** Pure logging + pattern recognition. Not a training course, not a vet app. The simplest tool for the most chaotic time.

### Localization Priority
1. English (US) — primary
2. English (UK)
3. Dutch (NL) — Jaap's home market, easy win
4. German — large pet market
5. French

### Review Strategy
- Prompt for review after 7 days of consistent use (they're invested by then)
- Or after a milestone moment ("First full week — all potty outside! 🎉 Enjoying Ollie? A review helps other puppy parents find us.")
- Never prompt during onboarding or after a frustrating moment
