## Description
```
Puppyhood is chaos. Ollie brings the calm.

Your puppy lives in the now. Ollie helps you think ahead. Track meals, potty breaks, sleep, walks, and milestones — and actually understand what your puppy needs.

ONE-TAP LOGGING
Log events in seconds. No fiddly forms, no typing. Open the app, tap, done. Because you've got a puppy chewing your shoelace right now.

SMART PREDICTIONS
When was the last potty break? How long has she been napping? Ollie tracks the gaps and streaks so you don't have to count. Get a gentle nudge before the accident happens.

DAILY JOURNAL
A beautiful timeline of your puppy's entire day. Look back and see everything at a glance — or share it with your partner so you're both on the same page.

WEEKLY PATTERNS
See how sleep, meals, and potty breaks change over time. Spot what's working. Celebrate the wins — like that first full week without indoor accidents.

BUILT FOR THE FIRST YEAR
Ollie is designed for the intense, beautiful, exhausting first year of puppyhood. Whether you're preparing for your puppy or already in the deep end — just start logging. Patterns emerge fast.

Built by a puppy parent, in the trenches, for the trenches.
